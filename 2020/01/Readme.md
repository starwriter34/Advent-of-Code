[Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1)

After saving Christmas five years in a row, you've decided to take a<br>
vacation at a nice resort on a tropical island. Surely, Christmas will go<br>
on without you.<br>

The tropical island has its own currency and is entirely cash-only. The<br>
gold coins used there have a little picture of a starfish; the locals just<br>
call them stars. None of the currency exchanges seem to have heard of them,<br>
but somehow, you'll need to find fifty of these coins by the time you arrive<br>
so you can pay the deposit on your room.<br>

To save your vacation, you need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.<br>

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each<br>
day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the<br>
first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!<br>

Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your **expense**<br>
**report** (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn't quite adding up.<br>

Specifically, they need you to **find the two entries that sum to 2020** and<br>
then multiply those two numbers together.<br>

For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:<br>

    1721
    979
    366
    299
    675
    1456

In this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299.<br>
Multiplying them together produces 1721 * 299 = 514579, so the correct<br>
answer is **514579**.<br>

Of course, your expense report is much larger. Find the **two entries that**<br>
**sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?**

The Elves in accounting are thankful for your help; one of them even offers<br>
you a starfish coin they had left over from a past vacation. They offer you<br>
a second one if you can find **three** numbers in your expense report that meet<br>
the same criteria.<br>

Using the above example again, the three entries that sum to 2020 are 979,<br>
366, and 675. Multiplying them together produces the answer, **241861950**.

In your expense report, **what is the product of the three entries that sum to 2020?**
